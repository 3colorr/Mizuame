What do you do when you want to store a text for a moment that you don’t mind losing later? In this case, Mizuame may assist you.

- It can serve as a temporary clipboard, complementing your work in other robust note apps.
- Just by writing a simple formula, it calculates automatically.
- Mizuame supports some Markdown syntax
  - This means that there are supported syntax elements as well as unsupported ones.

What is NOT SO GOOD point about the Mizuame?

- This app cannot backup your data, so that your data may be lost unintentionally due to device failure.
- You cannot paste images.
